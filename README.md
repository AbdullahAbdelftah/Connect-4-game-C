# Connect-4-game-C
This project is a connect 4 game made using C language. You can read the user manual Uploaded or the txt file to know more about the rules and the mechanisms.
First of all the game have slight changes in the rules which is the players have scores in the game and the gams doesn't end when a player completes a 4-line of his color.
The player to win needs to complete multiple connected 4's to win, which the connected four increases his score by one point.
Secondly, the game has a feature that allows the user to change the board dimensions through a xml file wich is easy to the user to do and also to change how much highscores will be printed in the highscores section.
The game has another feature that allow the users to save the game and load it form load saved games section, and i will explain the saving and loading mechanism.
The saving allows the user to save at most 3 games and the starts to delete the oldest save and save in it. Ex: you have already 3 saves and you want to save a 4th game so the game automatically will delete save 1 and will save the 4th in it.
I hope you like the game and feel free to comment any suggestions <3.
